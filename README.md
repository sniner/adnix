# adnix

A little script to convert ad blocking hosts files provided by Dan Pollock
and Peter Lowe into an Unbound configuration file.

This script has been inspired by Gavin Brown's
[unbound-block-hosts](https://github.com/jodrell/unbound-block-hosts).


## Introduction

If you want to block advertisements, spyware and other unwanted content you
have a few choices:

* Install some add-ons in your favorite applications (so called 'Ad-blockers')
* Modify the /etc/hosts file on every client to redirect all hostname lookups
  to localhost
* Or make your site-local DNS server to do that for all clients

I don't use DNS servers of my ISP, instead I have an Unbound DNS server to
resolve all hostname lookups. This script downloads host lists maintained by
Dan Pollock and Peter Lowe that contain many hosts involved in advertisement,
spyware distribution, web trackers and other unwanted content. Output of this
script is a configuration file for Unbound, redirecting these hostnames to
localhost (you can change that if needed).


## Requirements

* unbound > 1.4.x
* Ruby 2.x


## Usage

This is a very short description of my own setup at home.

### Unbound

Configuration located in /etc/unbound. I added a subfolder /etc/unbound/conf.d/
and reduced /etc/unbound/unbound.conf to a bare minimum:

        server:
            include: "/etc/unbound/conf.d/*.conf"

The other configuration files are located in that conf.d subfolder, including
the file produced by this script.

### Periodic update

Create a cronjob for the update_unbound script and run it once every week or
month. I don't think the lists will change very often.
